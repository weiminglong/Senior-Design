hello
Chicago
it's
good
to
be
home
if
I
have
told
you
eight
years
ago
the
America
would
reverse
the
Great
Recession
reboot
our
Auto
industry
and
unleash
the
longest
stretch
of
job
creation
in
our
history
if
I
told
you
are
we
would
open
up
a
new
chapter
with
the
Cuban
people
shut
down
around
nuclear
weapons
program
without
firing
a
shot
take
out
the
Mastermind
of
9/11
if
I
had
told
you
that
we
would
win
marriage
equality
and
secure
the
right
to
health
insurance
for
another
20
million
of
our
fellow
citizens
if
I
told
you
all
that
you
might
have
said
no
sites
were
said
a
little
too
hot
but
that's
what
we
did
I
can't
do
that
after
my
election
there
was
talk
of
a
post-racial
America
and
such
a
vision
however
well
intended
was
never
realized
race
remains
a
potent
and
often
to
visit
force
in
our
society
if
you're
tired
of
arguing
with
strangers
on
the
internet
play
talking
with
one
of
them
in
real
life
if
you're
disappointed
by
your
elected
officials
grab
a
clipboard
get
some
signatures
and
run
for
office
yourself
show
up
diamond
stay
at
it
sometimes
you
win
sometimes
you'll
lose
Michelle
lavaughn
Robinson
girl
of
the
south
side
you
made
the
White
House
a
place
to
belong
to
everybody
on
the
new
generation
sets
its
sights
higher
because
it
has
you
as
a
role
model
Malia
and
Sasha
I've
all
that
I've
done
in
my
life
I
am
most
proud
to
be
your
day
for
too
many
of
us
become
safer
to
retreat
into
our
own
bubbles
weather
in
our
neighborhoods
or
on
college
campuses
or
places
of
worship
or
especially
our
social
media
feeds
surrounded
by
people
who
look
like
us
and
share
the
same
political
Outlook
and
never
challenge
our
assumptions
and
increasingly
we
become
so
secure
in
our
bubbles
that
we
start
accepting
only
information
whether
it's
true
or
not
that
fits
our
opinions
instead
of
basing
our
opinions
on
the
evidence
that
is
out
there
I'm
asking
you
to
hold
fast
to
that
Faith
written
into
our
founding
documents
that
ideal
whisper
by
slaves
and
abolitionists
that
Spirit
sung
by
immigrants
and
homesteaders
and
those
who
March
for
justice
that
Creed
reaffirm
by
those
who
planted
flags
from
foreign
Battlefield
to
the
surface
of
the
Moon
are
created
at
the
core
of
every
American
who
story
is
not
yet
written
yes
we
can
yes
we
did
yes
we
can
thank
you
God
bless
you
