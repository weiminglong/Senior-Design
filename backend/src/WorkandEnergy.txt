welcome
back
I'm
not
going
to
introduce
you
to
the
concepts
of
work
and
energy
and
these
are
two
words
that
are
rhyme
sure
you
use
in
your
everyday
life
already
have
some
notion
of
what
they
mean
but
maybe
just
not
in
the
physics
contacts
although
they're
not
completely
unrelated
so
work
and
you
know
what
work
is
work
is
when
you
do
something
you
go
to
work
you
make
a
living
in
physics
work
is
just
a
lot
of
words
and
and
they
actually
end
up
being
kind
of
circular
definitions
but
I
think
when
we
start
doing
the
math
will
start
to
get
at
least
a
slightly
more
intuitive
notion
of
what
they
all
are
so
work
is
energy
transferred
by
force
I'll
write
that
down
energy
transferred
and
I
got
this
from
Wikipedia
cuz
I
wanted
a
good
I
guess
relatively
intuitive
definition
energy
transferred
by
a
force
that
makes
reasonable
sense
to
me
but
then
you're
wondering
well
I
don't
know
forces
you
know
force
is
mass
times
acceleration
but
but
what
is
energy
that
I
looked
up
energy
and
I
found
this
well
entertaining
but
it
also
I
think
Seth
tells
you
something
that
these
are
just
Concepts
that
we
use
to
I
guess
work
with
what
we
perceive
as
motion
and
force
and
and
work
and
all
of
these
types
of
things
but
that
they
really
aren't
independent
Notions
they're
they're
related
to
Wikipedia
to
find
energy
as
the
ability
to
do
work
so
they
kind
of
use
each
other
to
Define
each
other
I
really
need
to
do
to
do
work
which
is
frankly
as
good
of
a
definition
as
as
I
could
find
and
so
with
just
the
words
these
kind
of
don't
give
you
much
information
to
what
I'm
going
to
do
is
move
on
to
the
equations
and
this
will
give
you
more
quantitative
feel
of
what
these
words
mean
so
the
definition
of
work
mechanics
Work
is
equal
to
force
times
distance
so
let's
say
that
I
have
a
block
and
I'm
doing
the
different
color
just
because
it's
yellow
might
be
getting
tedious
and
I
apply
a
force
of
the
day
I
apply
force
of
10
Newtons
10
Newtons
and
I
move
that
block
by
4
by
applying
a
force
of
10
Newtons
I
I
move
that
block
with
to
move
it
I
don't
know
7
meters
7M
so
the
work
that
I
applied
to
that
block
or
the
energy
that
I
transferred
to
that
block
the
work
is
equal
to
the
force
which
is
10
Newtons
to
newtons
x
a
distance
x
7
and
that
it
would
equal
7010
*
7
newton
meters
so
newton
meters
is
one
one
by
Guess
way
of
of
describing
work
and
this
is
also
defined
as
one
joule
and
I'll
do
another
presentation
on
all
of
the
things
that
the
jewel
did
but
jewel
is
a
unit
of
work
and
also
the
unit
of
energy
and
they're
kind
of
transferable
because
if
we
look
at
the
definitions
of
Wikipedia
gave
us
work
is
energy
transferred
by
a
force
and
energy
is
the
ability
to
do
so
I'll
leave
these
this
relatively
circular
definition
definition
which
I
think
helps
us
a
little
bit
more
to
understand
the
types
of
work
we
can
do
and
then
what
kind
of
energy
we
are
actually
are
transferring
to
an
object
when
you
do
that
type
of
work
do
some
examples
let's
say
I
have
a
block
I
have
a
block
of
mass
m
I
have
a
block
of
mass
m
starts
at
rest
and
then
I
apply
Force
what's
a
apply
Force
f
for
a
distance
or
distance
off
I
think
you
can
guess
what
the
distance
I'm
going
to
apply
it
is
for
distance
of
D
so
I'm
I'm
pushing
on
this
block
with
a
force
of
f
for
distance
of
D
and
what
I
want
to
figure
out
as
well
we
know
what
the
work
is
the
I
mean
by
definition
whoops
work
is
equal
to
this
force
x
distance
that
I'm
applying
the
block
that
I'm
pushed
that
I'm
pushing
the
block
what
is
the
velocity
going
to
be
of
this
block
over
here
right
it's
going
to
be
something
something
somewhat
faster
right
because
Force
isn't
and
I'm
assuming
that
this
is
fiction
list
on
on
your
Force
isn't
just
moving
the
block
with
a
constant
velocity
force
is
equal
to
mass
times
acceleration
so
I'm
not
even
though
it's
stationary
Year
by
the
time
we
get
to
this
point
over
here
that
block
is
going
to
have
some
some
some
some
velocity
we
don't
know
what
it
is
cuz
we're
using
with
if
you
remember
your
your
kinematics
equations
and
if
you
don't
you
might
want
to
go
back
if
you've
ever
seen
the
videos
there's
a
whole
set
of
videos
on
projectile
motion
and
kinematics
but
we
figured
out
that
when
accelerating
an
object
over
distance
that
the
final
velocity
change
colors
just
for
variety
the
final
velocity
squared
is
equal
to
the
initial
velocity
squared
plus
2
times
the
acceleration
times
the
distance
of
this
fact
and
so
I
won't
redo
it
now
but
in
this
situation
what's
the
initial
velocity
will
the
initial
velocity
was
Zero
write
the
equation
becomes
VF
squared
is
equal
to
2
times
acceleration
times
the
distance
and
then
we
could
rewrite
the
acceleration
in
terms
of
what
the
force
in
the
mass
right
so
what
is
acceleration
f
equals
Ma
or
acceleration
is
equal
to
force
divided
by
Mass
so
we
get
VF
squared
is
equal
to
2
times
the
force
divided
by
the
mass
times
the
distance
to
get
the
final
velocity
of
this
block
at
this
point
is
going
to
be
equal
to
the
square
root
âˆš
2
x
force
x
distance
divided
by
mass
I
thought
that's
how
we
could
we
could
figure
it
out
and
in
there
something
interesting
going
on
here
there's
something
interesting
and
this
is
what
we
did
just
now
do
you
see
something
that
looks
a
little
bit
like
work
will
sure
you
have
this
force
times
distance
expression
right
ear
force
x
distance
right
here
so
let's
try
another
question
if
we
if
we
know
the
the
given
amount
of
velocity
something
as
if
we
can
figure
out
how
much
work
needed
to
be
put
into
the
system
to
get
to
that
place
where
we
can
just
replace
force
times
distance
with
work
I
could
work
is
equal
to
force
times
distance
so
we
can
just
go
straight
from
this
equation
cuz
we
don't
have
to
be
square
it
so
we
could
vs
square
is
equal
to
2
x
force
x
distance
that's
work
abet
definition
right
here
to
times
work
/
the
mass
let's
multiply
both
sides
of
the
equation
x
a
mass
so
you
get
mass
times
the
velocity
I'm
going
to
get
rid
of
this
app
because
we
know
that
we
started
rest
and
that
the
velocity
is
going
to
be
this
is
called
be
so
m
x
v
squared
is
equal
to
2
times
the
work
what
does
divide
both
sides
by
2
or
that
the
work
is
equal
to
m
v
squared
/
2
/
2
and
of
course
that
you
do
here
is
Jules
so
this
is
interesting
now
if
I
know
the
velocity
of
an
object
if
I
know
the
velocity
of
an
object
I
can
figure
out
using
this
formula
which
hopefully
wasn't
too
complicated
to
drive
I
can
figure
out
how
much
work
was
imputed
into
that
object
to
get
it
to
that
velocity
and
this
by
definition
is
called
kinetic
energy
this
is
kinetic
energy
and
once
again
the
definition
that
that
Wikipedia
gives
us
is
the
energy
due
to
motion
or
the
work
needed
to
accelerate
from
from
an
object
from
being
stationary
to
its
current
velocity
and
I'm
actually
almost
out
of
time
but
what
I
will
do
is
I
will
leave
you
with
this
formula
the
kinetic
energy
is
mass
times
velocity
squared
divided
by
2
or
1/2
+
B
squared
it's
very
calming
formula
and
I'll
give
you
that
and
and
that
is
one
form
of
energy
and
I'll
leave
you
with
that
idea
next
video
I
will
show
you
another
form
of
energy
and
then
I
will
introduce
you
to
the
law
of
conservation
of
energy
and
that's
where
things
become
useful
because
you
can
see
how
one
form
of
energy
can
be
converted
to
another
to
figure
out
what
happens
to
an
object
I'll
see
you
soon
