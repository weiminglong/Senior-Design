what I want to talk about it this video are the Notions of electronegative electronegativity negativity negativity and a closely and a closely related idea of electron affinity electron affinity and they're so closely related that in general if something has a high electronegativity they have a high electron affinity but what does this mean well electron affinity is how much does that Adam attract electrons how much does it like electrons does it want does it maybe want more electrons electronegativity is a little bit more specific it when that Adam is part of a covalent bond what it is sharing electrons with another atom How likely is it or how badly does it want to hog the electrons in that covalent bond know what do I mean to buy hog electrons so let me make let me write this down so so how badly  badly wants  to hog this is an informal definition clearly hog electrons keep keep the electron to spend more of their time closer to them then to the other party the covalent bond and this is how how how much they like attract electrons or how how how much Affinity they have tours electron so how much  they want want electrons and you can see that these are very these are very related Notions this is within the context of a covalent bond how much electron affinity is there while this you can think of it as a slightly brought an ocean but these two trends go absolutely in line with each other and to think about to just think about electronegativity make a little bit more tangible let's think about one of the most famous sets of covalent bonds are that's what you see in a water molecule water as you probably know is H2O you have an oxygen atom and you have two hydrogen's  each of the hydrogens have one valence electron and the oxygen has we see here in its outermost shell it has one two three four five six valence electrons 1 2 3 4 5 6 valence electrons and so you could imagine hydrogen would be happy if it was able to somehow pretend like it had another electron that it would have an electron configuration of stable first shell that only requires two electrons the rest of them require 800 Woodfield way I am I'm stable like helium if I could get another electron and oxygen would feel hey I'm stable like neon if I can get two more electrons that's what happens if they share each other's electrons this this electron could be shared and in conjunction with this electron for this hydrogen so that hydrogen can kind of feel like it's using both and it gets more stable it stabilizes the outer shell or it stabilizes hydrogen and likewise that electron could be can be shared with the hydrogen and it's the hydrogen can kind of feel more like helium and then this  student can feel like it's gets its it's a quid pro quo is getting something exchange for something else it's getting the electron in electron it's sharing electrons from each of these hydrogen and so can feel like it's that that that it is it stabilizes it's similar to a similar to a neon but when you have these covalent bonds only in the case where there are equally electronegative would you have a case where maybe there shouldn't even their what what happens in the rest of the molecule might matter but when you have something like this we have oxygen hydrogen they don't have the same electronegativity of oxygen likes to hog electrons more than hydrogen does it so these electrons are not going to spend an even amount of time here I did it kind of just drying these you know these valence electrons is a as is Aziz. But as we know the electrons are in this kind of blur around around the around the actual nuclei around the atoms that make up the atoms and so in this type of a covalent bond the electrons the two of us  price of this Bond represents are going to spend more time around the oxygen that they are going to expand around the hydrogen and these these two electrons are going to spend more time around the oxygen that are going to spin around the hydrogen and we know that because oxygen is more electronegative we'll talk about the trends in the second this is a really important idea in chemistry and especially later on as you study organic chemistry because because we know that oxygen more electronegative and the electrons been more time and around oxygen run hydrogen it creates a partial negative charge on this side and partial positive charges on this side right over here which is why water has many of the properties that it does that it if we go into much more depth in that in other videos and also what you study organic chemistry a lot of the likely reactions that are going to happen can be predicted a lot of the likely molecules that form can be predicted based on electronegativity and especially when you start going into oxidation numbers and things like that  he will tell you a lot so now that we know what electronegativity is let's think a little bit about what is as we go through as we start as we go through a as we go through a period that says we started group one and we go to group and as we go all the way all the way to the halogens all the way up to the yellow column right over here what do you think is going to be the trend for electronegativity and once again one way to think about is think about the extreme think about sodium and think about chlorine and I encourage you to pause a video on think about that  to me you had a go at it and it's in some ways the same idea or is a similar ideas ionization energy and electron something like sodium has only one electron in its outermost shell it would be hard for it to complete that she'll and so to get to stable say it's much easier for it to give away that one electron that has so it couldn't get to a stable configuration like neon so this one really wants to give away hey an electron and we said we saw the video and ionization energy that's why this has a low ionization energy doesn't take much energy to in a gaseous state to remove an electron from sodium or chlorine is the opposite it's only one away from completing a shell the last thing I want to do is give away electron it wants an electron really really really really badly so it can get to configuration of argon so I can complete its third shell the logic here is it sodium wouldn't wouldn't mind giving away an electron What chlorine really would love an electron to chlorine is more likely to hog electron while sodium is  unlikely to hog electrons so this trend right here when you go from the left to the right your electronegativity let me write this you're getting more electronegative more Electro electronegative as you as you go to the right is going to be as you go down as you go down in a group what do you think the trend is going to be as you go down  well I'll give you a hint think about think about atomic radii and given that positive thing what would you think the trend is already getting more or less electronegative as we move down  so once again I'm assuming you've given a go at it so as we know from the video on atomic radii are are atoms getting larger and larger and larger as we had more and more and more shells and so cesium has one electron in its outermost shell in the sixth shell while say lithium has one one electron everything here all the group 1 element have one Liquors outermost shell but that was at 55th electron that one electron the atom with Sean cesium is a lot further away than the outermost electron in lithium ore in hydrogen and so because of that it's it's it's it's the one there's more interference between that electron and the nucleus from all the electrons in between them and also is just further away so it's easier to kind of grabbed it off so cesium is is very likely to give up is very likely to give up electrons it's much more likely to give up electrons than hydrogen so as you go down a given group you're becoming less less electronegative  electronegative so what what are based on this what are going to be the most electronegative of all the atoms where they're going they're going to be the ones that are in the top and the right of the periodic table they're going to BD's right over here these are going to be the most electronegative sometimes we don't think as much about the noble gases because they aren't they aren't really that reacted they don't even form covalent bond because they're just happy well these characters up here they sometimes will form covalent bonds and when they do they really like to hug those electrons and what are the least electronegative sometimes called very electropositive what is things down here in the bottom left these over here they have only known case of cesium they have one electron to give away that would take them to a stable State like like Xenon or in the case of these out in his group 2 element have to give away to it's much easier to give away to then to gain a whole bunch of them and they're big their big Adam so those outermost electrons are getting less  attracted to the positive nucleus so the trend in the periodic table as you go from the bottom left to the top right  you are getting more more Electro Electro negative everything we've done up to now has dealt with Cartesian coordinates even though you might have not realize that they were Cartesian coordinates cuz I never called it that before just now so what is a Cartesian coordinate me draw the axes of your hopefully familiar with by now if you're not review those videos on the y-axis and the x-axis as a Cartesian coordinates and actually they can apply to more than just two Dimensions but two Dimensions is what we tend to deal with  it if I want to specify any point in two dimensional space I just tell you how far kind of in The X Direction I have to go and how far in the y direction and I can specify that point like let's see if I said well let me give the Cartesian coordinates for that point right there and I might say well to get to that point right there I have to go to the right three steps  so this is three right here and then I have to go up for steps 1 2 3 4 and you end up there and buy convention called us the x-coordinate we call this the y-coordinate and we call this 3, for this is just a convention where we say the first coordinate is how far in the X direction we go and the second coordinate is how far the up and down or the wide receiver has three, four to the right and for up or we could have gone for up and threw the right we've got to the exact same point this is just one way to really specify Dimensions another option might have done this and everyday life is to say hey let me just Point direction if you go a certain distance in that direction so I could have said you know what let me disappoint you in this direction  let me just point you in that direction you need to go this far and you do go this far  and that direction that would also give you the same point so how do I specify the direction well how about I call this 0° how about I call this the x-axis how about a combat zero degrees what degrees but hopefully you know how to convert between degrees and radians so you could just as easily convert to radians but you could specify the direction if you call this is zero saying okay this is stated degrees and I want you I'm going to point you in a degree in Unix analyst imagine you know someone who's blindfolded you point them in this direction and you say walk are units and then no end up at that same point and so you could also specify this point it says Best Buy this is kind of the Cartesian coordinates this is  X, Y you could also specify it maybe if we can figure out a way to do it and I'll do it in magenta you could also specified is R, Theta just walk are units in the fate of Direction but let me love you just a little Pythagorean theorem can we figure out our and data will our hopefully he's is as the easier one here cuz if you think about it this is a right triangle right this is right triangle has distance 3 this is distance for  this is a right triangle so what is are here but the Korean theorem 3 squared + 3 squared + 4 squared is equal to r squared that's 9 + 16 is equal to r squared 25 is equal to our school we don't want to deal with negative distances so 5 is equal to r r is equal to 5  so what are we know here we know what we're trying to figure out Theta and we know it's opposite side right this is us going back to sohcahtoa right let me write down sohcahtoa sohcahtoa this is completely unfamiliar to you you might want to watch the basic trigonometry video  so we know the opposite side of data right that's for and we also know the adjacent side which is 3 so which which is the trig functions uses the opposite and the adjacent all the toe opposite and adjacent to a tangent so tangent of theta tangent of theta is equal to the opposite which is really the y-coordinate which is equal to 4  over the adjacent which is the x coordinate was just three so tangent of theta is equal to 4/3 + 2 solve this you were sent you just take the inverse tangent of both sides of this so this is the same thing and depending on your calculator at the convention to use you might write this when you take the inverse tangent of boatsides you get well I'll just write it. You could write it as the arctan arctan  of the tangent of theta is equal to the arctan  a 4/3 and this of course the arctan of the panda this is the same thing as the inverse tan of theta that just simplifies Theta is equal to Arc a 4/3 another way to write arctan is often they'll often write it already so the same exact statement could be written is 10  inverse to the negative 1 power they sometimes a doll that's a little too little you know it's a little misleading sometimes when they ride it like this cuz you don't know I might take the whole tangent of theta to the negative power or something but sometimes of arctan is 10 to the negative 1 power but either way so we can figure out data by taking the arc tangent of 4/3 and most people do not have the arc tangent of 4/3 memorized and I don't know what easy way to figure it out without getting my TI-85 out so let's get it out  alright so how do we know that our chance we want to do the inverse calculator up a little higher as you can stand right here for a second inverse tangent 4/3 and I already set my calculator to degree mode it gives you 53.13 degrees  solterra is equal to 53.13 degrees in the two-dimensional plane by the point x is equal to 3 Y is equal to 4 we can also specified by our is equal to 5 3/8 is equal to 53 degrees it's all right that could also in polar coordinates are is equal to 5 m fada is 53.13 degrees 53.3 53.13 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise from the x-axis and then walk 5 units and we'll get to the exact same point and that's all polar coordinates are telling you let's do another one actually before that let's see if we can come up with something general here  once you have the general then then you can always solve for the particular  let me just write an arbitrary point last time I give a specific point the point was it three, four I think it was x, y  X, Y it's right there does x coordinate is there a y coordinate is there so how do we convert this to our to Polar coordinates R Theta always do the same thing we didn't last video if this is this length is our and this angle is Theta  so just going to do what we did last video you spell staggering dare we say that plus what does this distance here is also why I write this distance years X but I agree in theory X Plus y squared is equal to our Square that's just the Pythagorean theorem and then you have the tangent of theta the tangent of this angle of theta sohcahtoa toe opposite over adjacent tangent of theta is equal to the opposite which is why  over the adjacent which is X and this is really all you need and if you wanted to go one step further this is actually something that you could you should kind of right at the side of your paper how can we express wise a function if we wanted to go the other way if we were given aren't they talking we get why was think about it why if we want to know if we have if we give an r and Y and we want for a fade or what deals with the r and the Y with respect to data are as a hypotenuse and why is the opposite of the right sohcahtoa down  so  TOA  so what deals with the opposite and the hypotenuse  opposite and hypotenuse sign so the sine of theta the sine of theta is equal to the opposite which is the Y side which is equal to Y over the hypotenuse which is are  sequel to our and so if you multiply both sides by are you get what are sine Theta  is equal to Y and then let's do it the other way what if we wanted at have an equation for Theta R and x x is adjacent to the angle are still the hypotenuse so what is with adjacent and hypotenuse with ATS cosine so we have the cosine of theta is equal to the adjacent is equal to X over the hypotenuse which is our multiply both sides by RN you get X is equal to our cosine Theta and really when you're quick with this formula which you can easily drive that one  and this one was just as the Pythagorean theorem you're fully equipped convert between polar and rectangular coordinates
