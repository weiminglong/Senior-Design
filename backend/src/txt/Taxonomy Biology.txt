all
right
so
at
this
point
shortcut
to
make
life
a
lot
easier
at
least
I
just
want
to
find
the
derivative
of
each
one
of
these
the
first
ones
quite
easy
f
x
equals
x
to
the
tank
says
that
power
we
just
pulled
that
number
out
front
so
that
we
simply
subtract
1
from
our
exponent
to
use
that
long
definition
at
the
Vex
+
H
-
f
of
x
over
a
to
take
you
quite
a
bit
of
a
kind
of
nice
out
how
quick
and
easy
we
can
get
the
solution
look
at
our
next
week
near
G
of
x
equals
x
+
3
x
+
4
okay
case
of
the
5/2
that's
going
to
come
out
front
brakes
little
better
sore
5/2
is
going
to
come
right
out
front
then
we
have
to
subtract
one
so
maybe
I'll
write
that
is
going
to
be
our
new
exponent
a
swell
when
you're
multiplying
by
a
constant
so
the
one
with
the
exponent
0
Carson
is
Jesse
0
+
4
pretty
well
so
we
got
5/2
times
x
to
the
5
have
well
give
us
3
/
2
a
number
and
raise
it
to
the
zero
power
we're
going
to
get
just
one
we
can
just
write
3
*
3
*
1
+
0
*
x
+
3
so
what
happened
out
front
like
normal
number
times
basically
and
last
but
not
least
let's
look
at
our
last
one
here
hmx
equals
1
over
X
and
maybe
just
to
remind
you
remember
the
x-rays
to
the
m
and
then
turn
right
that
has
x-rays
to
come
over
to
the
first
Power
underneath
derivative
rule
I
can
rewrite
the
negative
one
third
spot
where
I
can
take
the
derivative
third
subtract
1
but
I
can
write
3/3
common
denominators
is
-1
/
3x
negative
negative
negative
negative
1
over
x
to
the
positive
so
kind
of
Al
using
this
little
rule
appear
first
we
have
x
to
the
fourth
power
so
that's
how
we
could
sort
of
rewrite
it
all
again
using
radical
notation
so
I
just
kind
of
some
basic
rules
here
you'll
use
these
all
the
time
in
calculus
definition
license
much
easier
now
so
but
again
now
the
fun
part
is
they're
going
to
give
you
really
complicated
to
make
life
a
lot
easier
when
taking
derivatives
