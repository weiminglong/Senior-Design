what
I
want
to
do
in
this
videos
come
up
with
an
expression
for
finding
the
sum
from
I
equals
0
to
n
of
I
squared
so
if
I
were
to
expand
this
out
this
is
equal
to
this
is
equal
to
0
squared
+
1
squared
+
2
squared
+
3
squared
and
we're
going
to
keep
on
going
all
the
way
to
and
square
to
my
goal
is
to
find
some
type
of
a
function
that
you
give
me
the
end
and
I
will
find
the
the
the
sum
from
0
squared
1
square
to
put
all
the
way
to
+
sqrt
until
you
come
out
of
that
be
useful
because
this
might
be
okay
if
it
is
reasonably
small
but
it
has
a
big
number
this
is
going
to
take
you
forever
to
do
the
list
for
study
this
was
study
what
kind
of
the
input
in
the
output
of
this
function
needs
to
be
so
the
input
is
going
to
be
RN
so
here
are
starting
with
Sol
and
can
go
from
zero
all
the
way
around
strap
a
bunch
of
values
went
to
be
zero
and
could
be
we
can
go
from
zero
all
the
way
to
zero
and
to
be
one
and
could
be
too
and
could
be
3
and
we
could
just
keep
on
going
on
and
on
and
on
I'll
just
stop
there
for
now
if
you
want
to
go
to
for
just
for
fun
and
now
for
each
of
these
let's
see
what
the
output
of
our
function
should
be
the
output
of
the
function
should
be
this
thing
it
should
be
the
sum
from
I
equal
0
to
n
of
I
squared
so
when
and
is
0
what
is
going
to
be
0
sqrt
we
just
stop
right
over
there
so
that's
just
a
01
and
is
1/0
squared
+
1
squared
so
that
is
1
when
n
is
220
squared
+
1
squared
+
2
squared
+
1
+
5
+
1
+
4
which
is
5
when
n
is
3
now
we
go
all
the
way
to
three
pieces
going
to
be
1
+
4
+
5
+
925
+
9
is
14
and
then
when
n
is
for
we're
going
to
go
we're
going
to
add
the
16
Foursquare
to
this
is
so
this
is
us
to
30
and
of
course
we
could
keep
going
on
and
on
and
on
who
studied
us
a
little
bit
to
think
about
what
type
of
annex
what
type
of
a
function
we
might
be
that
might
for
each
of
these
inputs
might
give
us
this
type
of
it
out
but
it
was
first
look
at
the
difference
between
these
two
are
the
difference
here
is
one
difference
here
is
for
this
is
obvious
we
added
one
here
we
had
two
squared
here
we
had
a
3
squared
or
9
here
we
had
it
for
square
door
16
here
and
the
reason
why
I'm
doing
this
is
if
this
was
a
linear
functions
and
beat
the
difference
between
successive
terms
would
be
the
same
now
this
is
a
quadratic
function
than
the
differences
between
the
differences
would
be
the
same
we'll
see
if
that's
the
case
so
the
difference
here
is
one
the
different
tiers
for
so
the
difference
between
those
three
difference
here
is
is
5
difference
here
is
Sabbath
to
even
the
difference
of
the
differences
is
increasing
but
if
this
is
a
cubic
function
than
did
the
differences
of
the
difference
of
the
difference
should
be
constant
so
see
if
that's
the
case
you'll
appreciate
this
even
more
when
you
start
learning
calculus
so
is
he
the
diff
between
3:33
and
5
is
to
the
difference
between
5
and
7
is
too
and
so
we
keep
having
a
constant
shift
of
to
so
the
fact
that
the
difference
of
the
difference
of
the
difference
is
fixed
tells
us
that
week
we
should
be
able
to
express
this
as
some
type
of
a
cubic
function
so
this
weekend
right
as
this
should
be
equal
to
sum
function
in
terms
of
and
we
could
write
it
as
a
end
to
the
third
plus
b
and
squared
plus
c
x
and
plus
d
and
now
we
can
just
use
the
what
the
inputs
are
the
outputs
are
of
these
to
solve
for
a
b
c
and
d
and
I
encourage
you
to
encourage
you
to
to
do
that
what's
first
think
about
when
n
is
equal
to
zero
wood
and
is
equal
to
zero
this
function
evaluates
2D
so
this
function
evaluates
2D
and
we
did
that
function
used
to
evaluate
the
zero
Saudi
needs
to
be
zero
so
I'm
just
trying
to
fix
those
these
letters
here
to
get
the
right
output
so
when
a
man
has
a
zero
this
expression
of
value
is
2D
and
it
needs
to
evaluate
2-0
Saudi
needs
to
be
equal
to
0
Saudi
is
equal
to
0
or
we
could
just
ignore
it
so
that
helped
us
a
little
bit
we
know
from
this
data
point
we're
able
to
whittle
it
down
to
it
having
this
form
right
over
here
and
so
now
we
can
make
each
of
these
inputs
figure
out
what
and
figure
out
what
their
corresponding
output
is
supposed
to
do
that
I'll
do
that
over
here
so
when
and
as
one
this
thing
evaluates
do
when
a
man
is
one
who
to
send
a
new
color
when
an
is
one
this
thing
evaluates
to
a
x
1/3
to
1
to
the
3rd
power
to
which
is
1
+
B
*
1
squared
which
is
just
one
plus
C
*
1
which
is
a
c
and
this
needs
to
be
equal
to
1
what
needs
to
be
equal
to
one
now
when
when
n
is
to
when
at
is
too
we
have
a
Time's
end
to
the
3rd
so
that's
eight
a
eight
a
plus
2
squared
is
4
+
4
b
+
2C
needs
to
be
equal
to
5
needs
to
be
equal
to
5
and
so
let's
go
to
3
so
8
*
3
to
the
3rd
power
so
that's
going
to
be
27
a
27A
+
9
b
+
9B
+
3c
+
3c
is
going
to
be
equal
to
is
going
to
be
equal
to
14
so
I
set
up
an
equation
three
equations
in
three
unknowns
now
I
just
have
to
solve
these
for
a
b
and
c
and
I
will
have
a
generalized
I
will
have
a
generalized
generalist
formula
for
finding
the
sum
of
the
first
of
finding
this
song
right
over
here
this
is
some
of
the
first
N
squared.
The
first
n
numbers
squared
I
guess
you
could
call
it
the
way
I
want
to
do
now
is
I'm
going
to
stop
this
video
I
encourage
you
to
try
to
solve
the
simultaneous
equation
on
your
own
in
the
next
video
I'll
actually
go
and
solve
it
