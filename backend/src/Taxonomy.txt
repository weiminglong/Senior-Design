taxonomy
is
the
science
of
classifying
living
thing
that
sounds
exciting
today
we'll
basically
be
learning
the
Dewey
Decimal
System
Of
Evolution
it's
like
filing
must
be
on
the
edge
of
your
seat
okay
shut
up
when
it
comes
down
to
it
the
science
doesn't
just
categorize
organisms
when
you
look
a
little
deeper
you
realize
it's
telling
the
story
of
all
life
on
Earth
and
it's
a
pretty
good
story
every
living
thing
on
this
planet
is
related
to
every
other
living
thing
if
you
go
far
enough
back
we
all
have
a
common
ancestor
an
organism
that
both
you
and
I
are
descended
from
or
something
that
a
starfish
and
a
blue
whale
or
both
descended
from
or
even
weirder
that
an
oak
tree
in
a
salmon
are
both
descended
from
that
organism
lived
it
live
very
long
ago
but
it
was
here
and
I
dig
that
taxonomy
is
basically
figuring
out
where
all
those
branches
of
the
evolutionary
tree
are
and
finding
some
convenient
label
to
help
us
understand
all
of
these
remarkable
into
relationships
let's
be
clear
though
taxonomy
isn't
about
describing
life
and
all
of
its
ridiculous
detail
mostly
about
helping
humans
understand
it
because
it's
way
too
complicated
without
structure
that
structure
biologists
use
the
taxonomic
system
to
classify
all
the
organisms
on
the
earth
it's
sometimes
called
the
phylogenetic
tree
for
the
tree
of
life
and
its
illustrates
The
evolutionary
relationships
between
all
living
species
2
million
known
species
there
could
be
anywhere
from
5
million
to
100
million
species
scientist
really
have
no
freaking
idea
new
species
keep
getting
discovered
all
the
time
in
the
more
organisms
we
have
to
keep
track
of
the
more
complex
the
phylogenetic
tree
becomes
always
a
consensus
about
how
to
classify
this
stuff
because
a
lot
of
the
natural
world
actually
let
me
rephrase
that
the
natural
world
is
one
giant
gray
area
sometimes
it's
hard
to
know
where
to
put
a
certain
group
of
organisms
and
eventually
the
group
get
so
big
the
classification
system
has
to
be
messed
with
to
make
room
for
it
so
system
isn't
perfect
but
it's
good
enough
that
we've
been
using
it
for
around
250
years
what's
up
do
you
spell
biography
coming
on
Carl
Linnaeus
was
a
Swede
born
in
1707
and
early
in
his
career
as
a
botanist
he
realize
that
the
Botanical
nomenclature
of
eighteenth-century
Europe
was
well
just
crap
for
instance
in
his
day
the
formal
name
of
a
tomato
plant
was
solanum
Caillat
and
never
met
or
basal
fullest
been
at
it
since
it
has
received
the
Simplicity
as
soon
as
I
actually
said
once
I
shudder
at
the
site
of
most
Botanical
names
given
by
modern
authorities
deleted
the
sloppiness
bother
him
he
saw
a
whole
sugar
storm
blowing
in
because
new
plants
were
still
being
discovered
in
Europe
but
that
was
nothing
compared
to
the
crazy
stuff
that
was
coming
from
the
new
world
when
I
saw
that
pretty
soon
naming
conventions
were
just
going
to
collapse
under
all
these
new
things
to
name
and
then
what
is
famously
started
off
by
naming
himself
again
from
a
peasant
family
and
at
that
time
surname
for
just
for
rich
people
so
when
call
went
to
college
they
asked
him
for
his
surname
and
he
just
made
one
up
Linnaeus
after
the
Linden
trees
that
grew
on
his
family's
Homestead
got
a
medical
degree
and
became
a
professor
at
Upsala
University
where
he
devoted
himself
to
the
study
of
nomenclature
he
had
two
students
go
to
places
and
bring
back
specimens
for
him
to
study
and
categorize
them
at
that
he
eventually
adopted
was
based
on
morphology
or
physical
form
and
structure
this
wasn't
necessarily
a
new
idea
back
then
people
grouped
organisms
by
analogous
or
homologous
traits
structures
that
appear
similar
but
actually
come
from
completely
independent
Origins
by
this
definition
Birds
would
be
more
closely
related
to
butterflies
than
to
reptiles
because
both
Birds
butterflies
can
fly
a
good
mind
for
this
stuff
and
turn
it
to
have
a
real
knack
for
choosing
actual
homologous
traits
for
his
classification
system
breaks
that
stem
from
a
common
evolutionary
ancestor
Didn't
Know
Jack
about
Evolution
Darwin
wouldn't
come
around
for
another
hundred
plus
years
but
he
intuited
that
some
traits
are
more
important
than
others
for
the
fact
that
reproductive
apparatus
seem
to
be
a
good
way
of
classifying
plants
he
also
caused
a
bit
of
a
scandal
by
classifying
class
mammalia
based
on
these
female
abilities
reduce
milk
from
their
nipples
go
to
pronounce
pretty
racy
stuff
back
then
in
his
lifetime
Linnaeus
catalog
roughly
7700
plants
and
4400
animals
he
published
his
classifications
in
a
catalog
called
system
and
the
cherry
wood
by
the
time
he
wrote
its
12th
edition
was
2300
pages
long
in
the
meantime
Linnaeus
actually
adopted
a
personal
motto
God
created
Linnaeus
organized
he
has
come
a
long
way
since
Lineas
we
still
use
a
bunch
of
the
conventions
that
he
invented
for
instance
we
still
arrange
things
into
taxa
or
groups
of
organisms
and
we
still
use
the
same
taxa
is
Linnaeus
kingdom
phylum
class
order
family
genus
and
species
we
also
still
use
the
masses
Convention
of
binomial
nomenclature
using
a
unique
two-part
name
for
every
species
of
the
genus
and
species
name
in
Latin
or
Latin
issue
in
the
Middle
Ages
when
educated
people
were
expected
to
know
Latin
we
know
a
lot
less
Latin
now
but
we
know
a
lot
more
about
evolutionary
which
Linnaeus
didn't
and
we
have
technology
is
like
genetic
testing
to
classify
relationship
between
organisms
and
yet
we
still
use
Linnaeus
is
morphology
based
system
because
genetic
evidence
generally
agrees
with
classifications
that
are
made
based
on
structure
and
form
because
there
was
a
lot
of
life
that
Linnaeus
had
no
idea
about
we
had
to
stick
a
new
tax
table
of
Linnaeus
is
Kingdom
we
call
it
domain
and
it's
as
broad
as
you
can
get
two
domains
are
bacteria
Archaea
and
Eukarya
bacteria
Archaea
are
prokaryotes
meaning
of
their
genetic
material
goes
Commando
with
no
nucleus
to
enclose
it
while
the
you
carry
a
makeup
all
of
the
life-forms
with
a
nucleus
and
include
pretty
much
all
of
the
life
that
you
think
of
his
life
and
quite
a
lot
of
the
life
that
you
don't
think
about
it
all
might
seem
like
since
all
macroscopic
life
only
gets
one
domain
kind
of
silly
to
give
prokaryotes
to
for
a
long
time
we
didn't
we
didn't
buy
them
up
in
the
different
domain
hung
out
together
in
a
single
domain
called
but
it
later
became
clear
that
bacteria
which
live
pretty
much
everywhere
on
Earth
including
inside
of
you
when
people
in
the
Earth's
crust
and
archaea
which
are
even
more
harder
than
bacteria
have
distinct
evolutionary
history
is
being
more
closely
related
to
eukaryotes
and
yes
that's
me
and
you
it's
only
different
cell
membranes
and
the
enzymes
that
they
used
to
make
RNA
there
are
Nephilim
race
is
much
more
like
ours
under
the
domain
Eukarya
which
is
by
far
the
most
interesting
and
even
occasionally
adorable
domain
we
have
Kingdom's
protista
fungi
plantae
and
Animalia
are
for
now
but
these
are
categories
that
are
a
human
creation
but
there
are
good
reasons
for
that
human
creation
scientific
truth
is
that
we
looked
at
life
and
divided
up
based
on
what
we
saw
so
we
were
like
protists
are
single-celled
organism
so
they're
very
different
from
the
rest
of
the
domain
and
plants
get
their
energy
from
the
Sun
and
Fun
guy
look
and
act
very
different
from
plants
and
animals
and
you
know
we
already
know
what
animals
are
so
they
have
Throne
Kingdom
in
those
scientists
are
sometimes
loath
to
admit
that
system
of
just
looking
and
dividing
things
up
actually
work
pretty
well
for
us
not
perfectly
but
pretty
well
there's
a
reason
why
this
works
so
well
evolutionarily
there
are
actual
categories
which
of
these
kingdoms
is
a
huge
branch
in
the
tree
of
life
at
H
branch
and
evolutionary
change
occurred
that
was
so
massively
helpful
that
it's
fond
of
vast
diversity
of
descendants
lamps
or
plantae
are
the
autotrophs
of
the
domain
Eukarya
autotrophs
meaning
that
they
can
feed
themselves
through
photosynthesis
of
course
they're
cellulose-based
cell
walls
and
chloroplasts
giving
them
a
distinct
difference
from
all
other
multicellular
life
there
are
two
other
sorts
of
tropes
there's
the
heterotrophs
which
get
their
energy
by
eating
other
organisms
and
the
chemotrophs
which
are
weird
and
crazy
and
only
show
up
in
bacteria
and
Archaea
and
they
get
their
energy
from
chemicals
out
of
Kingdom
Protista
is
weird
because
it
contains
both
autotrophs
and
heterotrophs
some
protists
can
photosynthesize
While
others
eat
living
thing
protists
are
basically
a
bunch
of
weird
eukaryotic
single-celled
organisms
that
may
or
may
not
be
evolutionarily
related
to
each
other
I'm
still
trying
to
figure
it
out
summer
plant
like
like
algae
summer
more
animal-like
like
amoebas
and
some
are
fungus-like
like
slime
molds
protists
are
one
of
those
gray
areas
I
was
telling
you
about
so
don't
be
surprised
if
by
the
time
you're
teaching
this
to
your
biology
students
there
are
more
than
four
Kingdoms
in
Eukarya
which
are
you
know
the
fungus
is
they
include
mushrooms
and
smuts
and
puff
balls
and
troubles
and
mold
and
yeast
and
they're
pretty
cool
because
they
have
cell
walls
like
plants
but
instead
of
being
made
of
cellulose
they're
made
of
another
carbohydrate
called
Titan
which
is
also
what
the
beak
of
a
giant
squid
is
made
of
where
the
exoskeleton
of
a
beetle
or
heterotrophs
like
animals
they
have
these
sort
of
digestive
enzymes
that
break
down
their
food
and
get
reabsorbed
but
they
can't
move
so
they
don't
require
a
stomach
for
digestion
they
just
grow
on
top
of
whatever
it
is
they're
digesting
and
I
just
the
right
where
it
is
just
super
finally
we
have
Kingdom
Animalia
which
is
the
lovely
Kingdom
that
we
find
ourselves
and
one
hundred
percent
of
adorable
organisms
in
animals
are
multicellular
always
we
are
heterotrophs
fix
that
we
spend
a
lot
of
time
hunting
down
food
because
we
can't
make
it
ourselves
and
almost
all
of
us
can
move
at
least
during
some
stage
of
our
life
cycle
most
of
us
develop
either
two
or
three
germ
layers
during
embryonic
development
wait
for
it
unless
your
a
sponge
so
like
I
said
we
use
this
taxonomic
system
to
describe
the
common
ancestry
and
evolutionary
history
of
an
organism
let
me
at
the
phylogenetic
tree
you
can
tell
that
humans
are
more
closely
related
to
mice
and
we
are
two
fish
and
more
closely
related
to
fish
than
we
are
the
fruit
flies
so
how
about
we
pick
an
organism
all
the
way
through
the
taxa
from
Kingdom
to
species
just
to
see
how
it
works
I
know
this
Kitty
cuz
I
know
she'd
like
it
like
that
so
kitties
have
cells
that
have
nuclei
and
membrane
surrounded
organelles
and
their
melting
cellular
and
heterotrophic
and
have
three
germ
layers
of
cells
when
their
embryos
so
they're
in
the
kingdom
Animalia
have
a
spinal
cord
vertebrae
and
discs
in
between
them
and
they
have
a
tail
that
doesn't
have
a
butt
hole
at
the
end
of
it
like
a
worm
which
I'm
really
glad
about
and
that
puts
her
in
the
phylum
chordata
and
the
kitty
black
dates
gives
birth
to
young
like
a
cow
instead
of
laying
eggs
like
a
chicken
and
they
have
fur
and
three
special
tiny
bones
in
their
ears
that
only
mammals
have
so
there
in
the
class
mammalia
so
she's
more
closely
related
to
cow
then
to
chicken
good
enough
man
like
a
bunch
of
other
placental
mammals
that
eat
meat
like
weasels
the
must
haves
in
dogs
are
canines
kitties
are
in
the
order
Carnivora
have
there
in
the
cat
family
felidae
with
members
have
live
bodies
and
rounded
heads
and
except
for
cheetahs
retractable
Claws
and
they're
littler
than
tigers
and
Panthers
would
put
them
in
the
Felix
said
the
level
of
the
species
that
description
to
get
pretty
dang
detailed
so
let's
just
say
that
you
know
what
a
cat
is
so
the
species
name
is
Katniss
I
could
have
died
holding
cross
stitched
onto
a
pillow
for
you
to
leave
on
for
watching
our
Taxidermy
issue
did
you
learn
something
thanks
to
everybody
who
help
with
this
episode
together
if
you
have
any
questions
for
us
please
leave
them
on
Facebook

in

and
we
will
get
to
them
hopefully
very
quickly
I
will
see
you
next
time
taxonomy
hits
the
science
of
classifying
living
thing
that
sounds
exciting
today
we'll
basically
be
learning
the
Dewey
Decimal
System
Of
Evolution
it's
like
filing
must
be
on
the
edge
of
your
seat
okay
shut
up
when
comes
down
to
it
the
science
doesn't
just
categorize
organisms
when
you
look
a
little
deeper
you
realize
it's
telling
the
story
of
all
life
on
Earth
and
it's
a
pretty
good
story
every
living
thing
on
this
planet
is
related
to
every
other
living
thing
if
you
go
far
enough
back
we
all
have
a
common
ancestor
an
organism
that
both
you
and
I
are
descended
from
or
something
that
a
starfish
and
a
blue
whale
or
both
descended
from
or
even
weirder
that
an
oak
tree
in
a
salmon
are
both
descended
from
that
organism
lived
it
live
very
long
ago
but
it
was
here
and
I
dig
that
taxonomy
is
basically
figuring
out
where
all
those
branches
of
the
evolutionary
tree
are
and
finding
some
convenient
label
to
help
us
understand
all
of
these
remarkable
into
relationships
let's
be
clear
though
taxonomy
isn't
about
describing
life
and
all
of
its
ridiculous
detail
mostly
about
helping
humans
understand
it
because
it's
way
too
complicated
without
structure
that
structure
biologists
use
the
taxonomic
system
to
classify
all
the
organisms
on
the
earth
it's
sometimes
called
the
phylogenetic
tree
for
the
tree
of
life
and
its
illustrates
The
evolutionary
relationships
between
all
living
species
are
about
2
million
known
species
there
could
be
anywhere
from
5
million
to
100
million
species
scientist
really
have
no
freaking
idea
new
species
keep
getting
discovered
all
the
time
in
the
more
organisms
we
have
to
keep
track
of
the
more
complex
the
phylogenetic
tree
becomes
citizen.
Always
a
consensus
about
how
to
classify
this
stuff
has
a
lot
of
the
natural
world
actually
let
me
rephrase
that
the
natural
world
is
one
giant
gray
area
sometimes
it's
just
hard
to
know
where
to
put
a
certain
group
of
organisms
and
eventually
the
group
gets
so
big
the
classification
system
has
to
be
messed
with
to
make
room
for
it
so
system
isn't
perfect
but
it's
good
enough
that
we've
been
using
it
for
around
250
years
what's
up
do
you
spell
a
biography
coming
on
Carl

a

recima
Simplicity
as
soon
as
I
actually
said
once
I
shudder
at
the
side
of
most
Botanical
names
given
by
modern
authorities
not
only
did
the
sloppiness
bother
him
he
saw
a
whole
sugar
storm
blowing
in
because
new
plants
were
still
being
discovered
in
Europe
but
that
was
nothing
compared
to
the
crazy

that
was
coming
from
the
new
world
when
I
saw
that
pretty
soon
naming
conventions
were
just
going
to
collapse
under
all
these
new
things
to
name
and
then
what
is
famously
started
off
by
naming
himself
he
came
from
a
peasant
family
and
at
that
time
surname
for
just
for
rich
people
so
when
call
went
to
college
they
asked
him
for
his
surname
and
he
just
made
one
up
Linnaeus
after
the
Linden
trees
that
grew
on
his
family's
Homestead
got
a
medical
degree
and
become
a
professor
at
Upsala
University
where
he
devoted
himself
to
the
study
of
nomenclature
he
had
his
students
go
to
places
and
bring
back
specimens
for
him
to
study
and
categorize
did
was
based
on
morphology
or
physical
form
and
structure
this
wasn't
necessarily
a
new
idea
back
then
people
grouped
organisms
by
analogous
or
homologous
traits
structures
that
appear
similar
but
actually
come
from
completely
independent
Origins
by
this
definition
Birds
would
be
more
closely
related
to
butterflies
than
to
reptiles
because
both
Birds
butterflies
can
fly
for
this
stuff
and
turn
it
to
have
a
real
knack
for
choosing
actual
homologous
traits
for
his
classification
system
traits
that
stem
from
a
common
evolutionary
ancestor
Didn't
Know
Jack
about
Evolution
Darwin
wouldn't
come
around
for
another
hundred
plus
years
but
he
intuited
that
some
traits
are
more
important
than
others
for
the
fact
that
reproductive
apparatus
seemed
to
be
a
good
way
of
classifying
plants
he
also
caused
a
bit
of
a
scandal
by
classifying
class
mammalia
based
on
the
female
abilities
to
reduce
milk
from
their
nipples
cuz
Brandon
has
pretty
racy
stuff
back
then
it
is
Lifetime
One
S
catalog
roughly
7700
plants
and
4400
animals
he
published
his
classifications
in
a
catalog
called
system
in
the
church
which
by
the
time
he
wrote
its
12th
edition
was
2300
pages
long
in
the
meantime
Linnaeus
actually
adopted
a
personal
motto
God
created
Linnaeus
organized
taxonomy
has
come
a
long
way
since
Linnaeus
we
still
use
a
bunch
of
the
conventions
that
he
invented
for
instance
we
still
arrange
things
into
taxa
or
groups
of
organisms
and
we
still
use
the
same
taxa
is
Linnaeus
kingdom
phylum
class
order
family
genus
and
species
we
also
still
use
the
masses
Convention
of
binomial
nomenclature
using
a
unique
two-part
name
for
every
species
genus
and
its
species
name
in
Latin
or
Latin
issue
in
the
Middle
Ages
when
educated
people
were
expected
to
know
Latin
we
know
a
lot
less
Latin
now
but
we
know
a
lot
more
about
evolutionary
which
Linnaeus
didn't
and
we
have
technology
like
genetic
testing
to
classify
relationships
between
organisms
and
yet
we
still
use
Linnaeus
is
morphology
based
system
because
genetic
evidence
generally
agrees
with
classifications
that
are
made
based
on
structure
and
form
because
there
was
a
lot
of
life
that
Linnaeus
had
no
idea
about
we
had
to
stick
a
new
tax
table
of
Linnaeus
is
Kingdom
we
call
it
domain
and
it's
as
broad
as
you
can
get
two
domains
are
bacteria
Archaea
and
Eukarya
bacteria
Archaea
are
prokaryotes
meaning
of
their
genetic
material
goes
Commando
with
no
nucleus
to
enclose
it
while
the
you
carry
a
makeup
all
of
the
life-forms
with
a
nucleus
and
include
pretty
much
all
of
the
life
that
you
think
of
his
life
and
quite
a
lot
of
the
life
that
you
don't
think
about
it
all
might
seem
like
since
all
macroscopic
life
only
gets
one
domain
it's
kind
of
silly
to
give
prokaryotes
to
for
a
long
time
we
didn't
we
didn't
buy
them
up
in
the
different
domain
hung
out
together
in
a
single
domain
called
man
but
it
later
became
clear
that
bacteria
which
live
pretty
much
everywhere
on
Earth
including
inside
of
you
when
people
in
the
Earth's
crust
and
archaea
which
are
even
more
harder
than
bacteria
have
distinct
evolutionary
history
is
being
more
closely
related
to
eukaryotes
and
yes
that's
me
and
you
if
only
different
cell
membranes
and
the
enzymes
that
they
used
to
make
RNA
there
are
Nephilim
race
is
much
more
like
ours
under
the
domain
Eukarya
which
is
by
far
the
most
interesting
and
even
occasionally
adorable
domain
we
have
Kingdom's
protista
fungi
plantae
and
Animalia
are
for
now
but
these
are
categories
that
are
a
human
creation
but
there
are
good
reasons
for
that
human
creation
the
truth
is
that
we
looked
at
life
and
divided
up
based
on
what
we
saw
so
we
were
like
protists
are
single-celled
organism
so
they're
very
different
from
the
rest
of
the
domain
and
plants
get
their
energy
from
the
Sun
and
Fun
guy
look
and
act
very
different
from
plants
and
animals
and
you
know
we
already
know
what
animals
are
so
they
have
Throne
Kingdom
in
those
scientists
are
sometimes
loath
to
admit
that
system
of
just
looking
and
dividing
things
up
actually
work
pretty
well
for
us
not
perfectly
but
pretty
well
there's
a
reason
why
this
works
so
well
evolutionarily
there
are
actual
categories
YouTube
these
kingdoms
is
a
huge
branch
in
the
tree
of
life
at
8
Brandt
an
evolutionary
change
occurred
that
was
so
massively
helpful
that
it's
fond
of
vast
diversity
of
descendants
plants
or
plantae
are
the
autotrophs
of
the
domain
Eukarya
autotroph
meaning
that
they
can
feed
themselves
through
photosynthesis
of
course
they're
cellulose-based
cell
walls
and
chloroplasts
giving
them
a
distinct
difference
from
all
other
multicellular
life
there
are
two
other
sorts
of
tropes
there's
the
heterotrophs
would
get
their
energy
by
eating
other
organisms
and
the
chemotrophs
which
are
weird
and
crazy
and
only
show
up
in
bacteria
and
Archaea
and
they
get
their
energy
from
chemicals
the
Kingdom
Protista
is
weird
because
it
contains
both
autotrophs
and
heterotrophs
some
protists
can
photosynthesize
While
others
eat
living
things
protists
are
basically
a
bunch
of
weird
eukaryotic
single-celled
organisms
that
may
or
may
not
be
evolutionarily
related
to
each
other
I'm
still
trying
to
figure
it
out
summer
plant
like
like
algae
summer
more
animal-like
like
amoebas
and
some
are
fungus-like
like
slime
molds
protists
are
one
of
those
gray
areas
I
was
telling
you
about
so
don't
be
surprised
if
by
the
time
you're
teaching
this
to
your
biology
students
there
are
more
than
four
Kingdoms
in
Eukarya
which
are
you
know
the
fungus
is
they
include
mushrooms
and
smuts
and
puff
balls
and
troubles
and
mold
and
yeast
and
they're
pretty
cool
because
they
have
cell
walls
like
plants
but
instead
of
being
made
of
cellulose
they're
made
of
another
carbohydrate
called
Titan
which
is
also
what
the
beak
of
a
giant
squid
is
made
of
where
the
exoskeleton
of
a
beetle
or
heterotrophs
like
animals
they
have
these
sort
of
digestive
enzymes
that
break
down
their
food
and
get
reabsorbed
but
they
can't
move
so
they
don't
require
a
stomach
for
digestion
they
just
grow
on
top
of
whatever
it
is
they're
digesting
and
I
just
the
right
where
it
is
just
super
and
finally
we
have
Kingdom
Animalia
which
is
the
lovely
Kingdom
that
we
find
ourselves
and
one
hundred
percent
of
adorable
organisms
in
animals
are
multicellular
always
we
are
heterotrophs
fix
that
we
spend
a
lot
of
time
hunting
down
food
because
we
can't
make
it
ourselves
and
almost
all
of
us
can
move
at
least
during
some
stage
of
our
life
cycle
and
most
of
us
develop
either
two
or
three
germ
layers
during
embryonic
development
wait
for
it
unless
you
respond
so
like
I
said
we
use
this
taxonomic
system
to
describe
the
common
ancestry
and
evolutionary
history
of
an
organism
living
at
the
phylogenetic
tree
you
can
tell
that
humans
are
more
closely
related
to
mice
than
we
are
to
fish
and
more
closely
related
to
fish
than
we
are
the
fruit
flies
so
how
about
we
pick
an
organism
all
the
way
through
the
taxa
from
Kingdom
to
species
just
to
see
how
it
works
I
know
I
pick
this
Kitty
cuz
I
know
she'd
like
it
like
that
so
kitties
have
cells
that
have
nuclei
and
membranes
around
organelles
and
their
melting
cellular
and
heterotrophic
and
have
three
germ
layers
of
cells
when
their
embryos
so
they're
in
the
kingdom
Animalia
have
a
spinal
cord
vertebrae
and
discs
in
between
them
and
they
have
a
tail
that
doesn't
have
a
butt
hole
at
the
end
of
it
like
a
worm
which
I'm
really
glad
about
and
that
puts
her
in
the
phylum
chordata
and
the
kitty
black
dates
gives
birth
to
young
like
a
cow
instead
of
laying
eggs
like
a
chicken
and
they
have
fur
and
three
special
tiny
bones
in
their
ears
that
only
mammals
have
so
there
in
the
class
mammalia
so
she's
more
closely
related
to
cow
then
to
chicken
good
enough
man
like
a
bunch
of
other
placental
mammals
that
eat
meat
like
weasels
the
must
haves
in
dogs
are
canines
kitties
are
in
the
order
Carnivora
have
there
in
the
cat
family
felidae
with
members
have
live
bodies
and
rounded
heads
and
except
for
cheetahs
retractable
Claws
and
they're
littler
than
tigers
and
Panthers
would
put
them
in
the
Felix
said
the
level
of
the
species
that
description
to
get
pretty
dang
detailed
so
let's
just
say
that
you
know
what
a
cat
is
so
the
species
name
is
Katniss
I
could
have
died
holding
cross
stitched
onto
a
pillow
for
you
to
sleep
on
the
couch
watching
are
taxidermied
did
you
learn
something
