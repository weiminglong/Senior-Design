what
is
machine
learning
in
this
video
we
will
try
to
Define
what
it
is
and
also
try
to
give
you
a
sense
of
when
you
wanted
use
machine
learning
even
among
the
machine
learning
practitioner
is
there
isn't
a
wallet
at
the
definition
of
what
is
and
what
isn't
machine
learning
but
let
me
show
you
a
couple
of
examples
of
the
ways
that
people
have
tried
to
Define
it
hit
the
definition
of
wasn't
machines
are
named
Samuel
he's
a
fine
machine
learning
as
the
field
of
study
that
gives
computer
has
the
ability
to
learn
without
being
exposed
to
reprogram
Samuel
came
to
say
was
that
back
in
the
1950s
he
wrote
a
check
is
playing
program
and
the
amazing
thing
about
this
check
the
same
program
was
that
officer
Samuel
himself
wasn't
very
good
Checkers
player
but
what
he
did
was
he
had
the
program
has
a
thousands
of
games
that
gave
itself
and
I
watch
a
what
go
to
for
physician
intended
to
be
to
win
and
was
told
it
for
Physicians
tentatively
to
Lawson
the
check
is
playing
program
where
is
overtime
I
could
both
positions
and
what
a
bad
position
and
eventually
learn
to
play
Checkers
better
than
office
have
your
himself
was
able
to
this
was
a
remarkable
results
of
himself
not
feel
very
good
Checkers
player
but
because
the
computer
has
the
patience
to
play
tens
of
thousands
of
games
again
to
sell
no
human
has
the
patience
to
play
that
many
games
by
three
does
the
computer
was
able
to
get
so
much
Checkers
playing
experience
that
it
eventually
became
a
better
check
with
player
than
office
Samuel
himself
somewhat
informal
definition
and
an
older
one
just
the
funny
movies
in
definition
by
Tom
Mitchell
who's
a
friend
out
in
Carnegie
Mellon
sottong
Define
machine
learning
by
saying
that
a
well
posed
learning
problem
is
defined
as
follows
he
has
a
computer
program
is
there
to
learn
from
experience
evil
inspector
sometimes
pee
and
supplement
measure
cheap
performance
on
TV
as
measured
by
P
improve
experience
I
actually
think
he
came
up
with
this
definition
just
to
make
a
Ryan
e
would
be
the
experience
of
having
the
program
play
tens
of
thousands
of
games
of
games
of
the
top
tea
will
be
the
topic
of
play
Cactus
and
the
performance
measure
P
will
be
the
probability
that
when's
the
next
game
of
checkers
against
some
new
opponent
throughout
these
videos
besides
me
trying
to
teach
you
stuff
I
occasionally
I
ask
you
a
question
to
make
sure
you
understand
the
content
just
one
on
top
of
the
definition
of
machines
running
by,
tell
me
your
email
program
watches
which
email
you
do
or
do
not.
I
just
am
so
in
an
email
client
like
this
you
might
click
this
button
to
report
some
email
at
San
Bernardino
and
emails
you
marked
as
spam
email
program
learned
better
how
to
filter
spam
email
what
is
the
time
in
the
setting
in
a
few
seconds
the
video
of
pause
and
when
it
does
so
you
can
use
your
mouth
to
select
one
of
these
for
radio
buttons
so
that
to
let
me
know
which
of
these
before
you
think
is
the
right
answer
to
this
question
so
hopefully
you
got
that
this
is
the
right
answer
I'll
find
emails
is
it
talk
to
you
in
fact
the
definition
to
find
to
talk
to
you
if
a
phone
is
measure
P
and
the
some
Xperia
E
and
so
watching
you
label
emails
is
Domino's
down
this
would
be
the
experience
e
and
the
defection
of
e-mails
correctly
classified
that
might
be
a
performance
measure
P
and
so
I'll
talk
with
woman
on
the
talk
about
systems
for
phone
is
on
the
top
speed
on
the
performance
measure.
Proof
off
their
disappearance
e
is
it
called
to
have
to
teach
you
about
various
different
type
of
learning
algorithms
there
several
different
types
of
the
main
two
types
of
all
because
supervised
learning
and
unsupervised
learning
how
to
find
what
these
terms
mean
more
in
the
next
couple
videos
but
it
turns
out
that
intensifies
Ernie
here
is
we're
going
to
teach
this
how
to
do
something
where
is
an
unsupervised
learning
we're
going
to
let
it
burn
by
itself
don't
worry
if
he's
two
terms
don't
make
sense
yet
in
the
next
two
videos
I'm
going
to
say
exactly
what
these
two
types
of
learning
all
such
as
reinforcement
learning
and
recommended
system
but
it's
the
most
used
type
of
learning
albums
I'll
probably
supervised
learning
and
unsupervised
learning
and
how
to
find
out
in
the
next
two
videos
and
what's
been
hoping
pause
talkin
about
these
two
types
of
learning
out
of
it
it
turns
out
one
of
the
other
things
we've
been
through
all
the
time
on
in
Just
Cause
is
practical
advice
for
applying
learning
out
of
them
then
something
like
you
pretty
strongly
about
something
that
I
don't
know
of
any
other
university
teachers
teaching
about
a
set
of
tools
and
equally
important
or
more
important
than
giving
you
the
tooth
is
it
teach
you
how
to
apply
to
I
like
to
make
an
analogy
to
learning
to
become
a
carpenter
imagine
that
someone
is
teaching
you
how
to
be
a
carpenter
and
they
say
you're
the
hammer
screwdriver
for
good
luck
well
that's
no
good
right
do
you
have
all
these
tools
for
the
more
important
thing
is
to
learn
how
to
use
the
excuse
coffee
does
a
huge
difference
between
keep
the
people
that
know
how
to
use
these
machines
running
out
of
them
people
that
don't
know
how
to
use
these
two
well
here
in
Silicon
Valley
when
I
when
I
go
visit
different
company
even
if
the
top
Silicon
Valley
companies
very
often
I
see
people
trying
to
apply
machines
running
album
since
I'm
the
problem
and
sometimes
they'll
have
been
going
at
it
for
six
months
but
sometimes
when
I
look
at
what
to
do
my
I
say
you
know
I
could
have
told
them
like
G
I
could
have
told
you
six
months
ago
that
you
should
be
taking
over
and
hang
out
of
them
and
the
client
in
like
this
lady
modified
way
and
like
you're
trying
to
suppress
would
have
been
much
higher
about
how
if
you're
actually
trying
to
develop
a
machine
there
any
system
how
to
make
the
best
practices
types
of
vision
about
the
way
in
which
you
build
your
system
so
that
when
you're
fine
there
any
offer
you
less
likely
to
end
up
one
of
those
people
who
end
up
pursuing
some
off
for
six
months
that
you
know
someone
how
can
I
figure
out
just
walk
into
the
work
at
all
in
the
wake
of
time
for
six
months
so
I'm
actually
spend
a
lot
of
time
teaching
you
don't
both
of
best
practices
in
machine
learning
and
Ai
and
how
to
get
the
stuff
to
work
and
how
we
do
it
all
the
best
people
do
it
is
gluten
Valley
in
around
the
world
I
hope
to
make
you
one
of
the
best
people
and
knowing
how
to
design
and
build
stair
is
machine
learning
and
AI
systems
so
that's
her
name
and
you
saw
the
main
topics
I
hope
to
teach
in
the
next
video
I'm
going
to
Define
what
is
supervised
learning
and
after
that
what
is
unsupervised
learning
and
also
stopped
to
talk
about
when
you
would
use
each
of
them
